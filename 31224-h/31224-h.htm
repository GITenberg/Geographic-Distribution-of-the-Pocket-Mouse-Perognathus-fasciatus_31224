<h1>Geographic Distribution of the Pocket Mouse,<br />
Perognathus fasciatus</h1>

<h5>BY</h5>

<h3>J. KNOX JONES, JR.</h3>


<p>In his "Revision of the pocket mice of the genus Perognathus," Osgood
(1900:18-20) reviewed the distribution, as then known, of <i>Perognathus
fasciatus</i> and recognized two geographic races&mdash;<i>Perognathus fasciatus</i>
[<i>fasciatus</i>] Wied-Neuwied in eastern Montana and Wyoming and adjacent
parts of North and South Dakota, and <i>Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus</i>
Thomas, known only from the type locality at Loveland, Larimer County,
Colorado. Later, Cary (1911:61) described <i>Perognathus fasciatus litus</i>
as a pale subspecies occurring in the lower Sweetwater Valley and
adjacent parts of the Red Desert of south-central Wyoming. After 1911 no
important taxonomic contributions dealing with <i>Perognathus fasciatus</i>
appeared.</p>

<p>In studying the kinds of pocket mice known from Nebraska, I examined
thirteen specimens of <i>P. fasciatus</i> from the northwestern part of the
state which did not agree satisfactorily with the descriptions of any
known subspecies of <i>fasciatus</i>. This impelled me to examine material
from the entire range of <i>P. fasciatus</i>. This examination revealed that:
(1) <i>Perognathus callistus</i> Osgood, heretofore considered to be a full
species, should be reduced to subspecific rank under <i>P. fasciatus</i>; and
(2) specimens from eastern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Montana, South
Dakota and Nebraska represent an heretofore unrecognized subspecies.
Further investigation, however, revealed that <i>Perognathus flavescens
olivaceogriseus</i> Swenk, described from northwestern Nebraska (Swenk,
1940:6), is not <i>flavescens</i> but actually <i>fasciatus</i>. Since the
specimens on which Swenk's description was based were taken within the
range of this newly recognized subspecies, and since my examination of
the holotype shows it to be of the species <i>Perognathus fasciatus</i>, the
subspecific name <i>olivaceogriseus</i> is available.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p><p>The subspecies of <i>P. fasciatus</i> are most easily distinguished by color
of pelage, in which there is a general cline from northeast (dark) to
southwest (pale). Cranially, the subspecies are less distinct. The
skulls of <i>P. f. callistus</i> can be distinguished from those of the other
subspecies by several differences; however, among the other four
subspecies, only minor cranial differences are evident. Individual
variation was found to be greater than secondary sexual variation.</p>

<p><b>Perognathus fasciatus olivaceogriseus</b> Swenk</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Perognathus flavescens olivaceogriseus</i> Swenk, Missouri Valley
Fauna, 3:6, June 5, 1940, type from [Little Bordeaux Creek, sec.
14, T. 33 N, R. 48 W, 3 mi. E] Chadron, Dawes County,
Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geographic distribution.</i>&mdash;Southeastern Alberta, southeast to
eastern Wyoming and adjacent parts of South Dakota and Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;External measurements of the holotype and average and
extreme external measurements of six adults (five males and one
female) from several localities in eastern Wyoming are,
respectively, as follows: Total length, 124, 132 (125-140); length
of tail-vertebrae, 53, 63 (59-68); length of hind foot, 16.5, 17
(17-18); length of ear, 6.5, 6.6 (6.0-7.0). Color: Upper parts
Cream Buff, lined with black and giving a pale olivaceous
appearance; lateral line near (16'd) Light Ochraceous-Buff;
postauricular patches Cream Buff; subauricular patches and
underparts white; tail indistinctly bicolor, dusky above, whitish
below. Skull: Size medium for species (see Table 1); braincase and
auditory bullae moderately inflated; interorbital region narrow;
mastoidal region broad.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus</i>,
geographically adjacent to the northeast, <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i>
differs in: Upper parts paler, especially face which is heavily washed
with buff; hind foot smaller; skull averaging slightly smaller in all
measurements taken (especially least interorbital breadth and cranial
depth), except mastoidal breadth which is slightly more and
interparietal breadth, length of tympanic bulla and length of maxillary
tooth-row which are approximately the same. From topotypes of
<i>Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus</i>, geographically adjacent to the
south, <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i> differs in: Upper parts paler and less
drab; lateral line brighter and more ochraceous; underparts never buffy;
skull averaging larger in all measurements taken except interparietal
breadth and length of maxillary tooth-row which are smaller. From
topotypes of <i>Perognathus fasciatus litus</i>, geographically adjacent to
the southwest, <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i> differs in: Upper parts darker;
skull, when specimens of equal age are compared, averaging larger in
mastoidal breadth, interparietal breadth and basal length. From
topotypes of <i>Perognathus fasciatus callistus</i>, <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i>
differs in: Upper parts slightly darker, pelage not silky, coarser in
appearance; hind foot shorter; skull averaging smaller in all
measurements taken (especially mastoidal breadth), except interparietal
breadth which is more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>
<p>Swenk (<i>loc. cit.</i>) originally described <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i> as a
subspecies of <i>Perognathus flavescens</i>. I have examined the holotype,
kindly made available to me by Dr. Seth B. Benson of the Museum of
Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, and the paratype, in the
collection of the University of Nebraska State Museum. Neither is <i>P.
flavescens</i>, but both are clearly specimens of <i>P. Fasciatus</i> on the
basis of olive-gray dorsal coloration, larger over-all dimensions of the
skull, and in that the tympanic bullae do not meet anteriorly. In
addition, a third specimen from Glen, Nebraska, purported by Swenk to be
intermediate between <i>flavescens</i> and <i>olivaceogriseus</i>, has been
examined and found to be an immature <i>fasciatus</i>.</p>

<p>In the original description Swenk indicated the type locality as
Chadron, Dawes County, Nebraska. The locality given on the specimen
label of the holotype, however, is 5 mi. E Chadron. In addition, Swenk
(<i>loc. cit.</i>), in the paragraph preceding the description of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
<i>olivaceogriseus</i>, states that the holotype was actually taken on Little
Bordeaux Creek, sec. 14, T. 33 N, R. 48 W, 3 mi. E Chadron, on the farm
of L. M. Gates, who obtained the holotype. It seems best to restrict the
type locality to the place last mentioned.</p>

<p>Four specimens from southeastern Alberta recently reported by Moore
(1953:143) have been examined and seem best referred, among known
subspecies of <i>fasciatus</i>, to <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i>. They differ from
the latter in several minor cranial features and more drab back, sides
and lateral line. When adequate material is available they may prove to
be subspecifically different from <i>olivaceogriseus</i>. Moore referred
these specimens to <i>P. f. fasciatus</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from extreme northwestern Nebraska, including the holotype,
are slightly darker than specimens from eastern Wyoming. A specimen from
Ft. Steele, Wyoming, shows approach to <i>P. f. litus</i> in pale dorsal
coloration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the seven topotypes available to me, six show various degrees of
encroachment of the color of the lateral line upon the underparts,
giving the ventral surface a buffy appearance, the "distinguishing
character" of the subspecies according to Osgood (<i>op. cit.</i>:20). When
additional specimens are available, this character may be found to be
one of individual variation, although no specimens from other parts of
the range of the species have been found to exhibit it. Of the
subspecies <i>P. f. infraluteus</i>, each of the eight specimens examined by
me possesses buffy subauricular patches.</p>

<p>The specimen from 7 mi. N Ramah, Colorado, is slightly darker and less
drab than the topotypes and does not possess buffy underparts. The skull
of the specimen is broken but on the basis of characters of the pelage
it seems to be intermediate between <i>infraluteus</i> and <i>olivaceogriseus</i>
and is referred to the former on geographic grounds.</p>

length of tympanic bulla and cranial depth), except interparietal
breadth which is more.</p>

<p>No fully adult specimens of <i>P. f. litus</i> have been available to me for
this study. Two of the three specimens mentioned by Cary in the original
description (holotype not seen) have been examined and found to possess
adult pelage, but cranially they must be classed as young adults. These
specimens are paler than those of any other subspecies of <i>fasciatus</i>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total number, 9, as follows: <span class="smcap">Wyoming</span>:
<i>Carbon County</i>: 8 mi. SE Lost Soldier, 6700 ft., 1 (USBS).
<i>Fremont County</i>: Granite Mts., 1 (MZ). <i>Natrona County</i>: 5 mi. W
Independence Rock, 6000 ft., 4 (KU); Sun, 1 (USBS); 16 mi. S, 11

<p><b>Perognathus fasciatus callistus</b> Osgood</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Perognathus callistus</i> Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:28, September
20, 1900, type from Kinney Ranch, near Bitter Creek, Sweetwater
County, Wyoming.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Geographic distribution.</i>&mdash;East of the Green River in central and
southern parts of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and adjacent parts of
Moffat County, Colorado (see Figure 1).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;For comparisons with <i>Perognathus fasciatus litus</i>,
geographically adjacent to the north, see account of that subspecies.</p>

<p>When Osgood (<i>loc. cit.</i>) described <i>P. f. callistus</i> as a full species,
he characterized it as having " ... the attractive coloration of
<i>fasciatus</i>, but softer and more delicate. Its position is evidently
between <i>fasciatus</i> and <i>apache</i>, and its nearest relations are clearly
with the latter." He further remarked that, "Its large size immediately
separates it from <i>fasciatus</i> which it resembles externally, especially
before maturity."</p>

<p>Comparison of the average and extreme external measurements of ten adult
<i>P. f. callistus</i> from Sweetwater County, Wyoming, with adult
individuals of other subspecies of <i>P. fasciatus</i> shows that <i>callistus</i>
does not average larger than <i>P. f. olivaceogriseus</i> except in length of
hind foot and that it averages slightly smaller in all external
measurements than topotypes of <i>P. f. fasciatus</i>. Moreover, judging from
the accounts of Goldman (1918:24) and Durrant (1952:235), <i>Perognathus
apache caryi</i> (the subspecies of <i>P. apache</i> nearest to the range of <i>P.
f. callistus</i>) is significantly larger externally and has no trace of
olivaceous in the dorsal pelage.</p>

<p>Comparison of the skulls of <i>callistus</i> with a skull of <i>Perognathus
apache apache</i> from Wingate, New Mexico (USBS 137388), reveals the
following differences: Interparietal bone wider in <i>callistus</i>,
averaging 4.5 (as opposed to 4.0) and more pentagonal; lacrimal bone
shorter and stouter in <i>callistus</i>; tympanic bullae more inflated in
<i>callistus</i>; interorbital foramina larger in <i>callistus</i>; lower premolar
approximately the same size as the last lower molar in <i>callistus</i>,
approximately half the size of the last lower molar in <i>apache</i>.
Conversely, comparison of skulls of <i>callistus</i> with those of <i>P.
fasciatus</i> as concerns the above mentioned features reveals that they
closely resemble each other. In view of this resemblance it seems best
to arrange <i>callistus</i> as a subspecies of <i>P. fasciatus</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span></p>
<p><i>P. f. callistus</i> is distinct cranially from all other subspecies of <i>P.
fasciatus</i> in the narrowness of the interparietal, the greater length of
the tympanic bulla and the greater mastoidal breadth. The fine, silky
nature of the pelage is shared, to some extent, with <i>P. f. litus</i>.</p>

<p>A specimen from 27 mi. N, 37 mi. E Rock Springs, Wyoming, referred to
<i>callistus</i> resembles <i>litus</i> in pale dorsal coloration and slightly
wider interparietal. Four immature specimens from 25 mi. N, 38 mi. E
Rock Springs, also referred to <i>callistus</i>, have extremely pale juvenal
pelage and also are judged to be intergrades with <i>litus</i>.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
